# 140k-Anime-Face-Deepfake-Detection

A lightweight project for detecting deepfakes in anime-style faces using the 140k Anime Faces dataset.

##Dataset

- `train.csv`, `valid.csv`, `test.csv`: Metadata files for training, validation, and testing.
- `image_paths_labels.csv`: Contains image paths and their corresponding labels.

##Notebook

- `140kfaces.ipynb`: Main notebook for training and evaluating the deepfake detection model, download and run it. 

##Goals

- Build a classifier to distinguish real vs fake anime faces.
- Analyze model performance across various metrics.

##Tools

- Python, TensorFlow 
- Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
